# KompleteKontrolLightGuide
Python scripts that give you control over the lightguide

SynthesiaKontrol-MK1.py is a modified version of ojacques script, found here: https://github.com/ojacques/SynthesiaKontrol#windows

Gives Synthesia control over the light guide on your Komplete Kontrol MK1 device.

Lightguidekontrol.py makes it so that only the key you press lights up, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y33h81phKU

(that's not my example but it has the exact same effect on the keyboard)
